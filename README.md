# Text-Adventure

---
*This project is still in early development*
This is a game where you're in space and you try to survive. It will be **played in the terminal** with **ascii** text and and colours too.
This project is powered by **C#** and **Visual Studio**, and is my first C# project that isn't a 1 + 1 calculator(Not even kidding)
thanks to pendevx for helping out with this too :D
