# Text-adventure
My first C# game, on a terminal, this'll be interesting.

This is the things I'm aiming for
I just want to make a text-based game on a terminal
I want to have a character
some creatures to defeat
Inventory
Items
Choices
Text UI
Idk about the theme, but I'll go with the default fantasy theme
I want to do a scenario where you're and astronaut on a lonely ship, and you have to survive
that would be more fun tbh
thats what I want
