# Text-Adventure
### My first big project on C#. This game will be on a terminal. Thanks to pendevx for helping with this, becuase I'm a smol brain and I have 3 brain cells.

### Description:
This is a game that is terminal-based, and will have a text-ui in the future. This game is using C# as our main code language, and probably our only coding language.This is my first actual C# project that's not a calculator or a "Hello World". This one might take a while :)

*I guess you can use the code here to make your own game, or make stuff for my game. Its up to you pal, this is opensource...so yeah*
